Houses a few image assets for STB's web properties, generally for use as a simple CDN for image thumbnails used in third-party services, especially Resmark's online interface.

It is deployed to Netlify, used as a CDN.

The idea is to keep these assets separate from the black hole of website redesign incarnations, so that these assets are not tightly coupled to each iteration of the public-facing websites, and ultimately, so they don't get lost as the websites evolve.
